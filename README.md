This repository contains files regarding the master thesis titled "Regression on interatomic descriptor data: Direct solution strategies for linear regression in CPU and memory-constrained environments
".

The repository and instructions for running the code are in progress. This file will include all dependencies/instructions needed to run the code soon.

Not all codes will be runnable (until the laboratory releases the final version of QACE descriptors).
